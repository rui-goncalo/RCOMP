<h3>Structured Cabling</h3>

<h3> Inventory - Floor 0 </h3>

***Disclaimer:** To calculate how many outlets we have for each room, we used the structured cabling standards that specify a minimum of two outlets per work area, and also a ratio of two outlets for each 10 square meters of area.*


<h4>Room 2.0.1</h4>

in this room we’ll have an Intermediate Cross-Connect(IC) and a Horizontal Cross-Connect (HC) with 24 connectors. The IC receive optical fibre from the Main Cross-Connect (MCC) and will send the optical fibre to the HC. From HC, we’ll pass copper cable to outlets in the floor. The room - with 9.79m2 - will have 2 outlets.

<h4>Room 2.0.2</h4>

This room has 24.8 m2. With that, we use 6 outlets based in the logic described in the beginning of this document. In this room, like any other one, we have an outlet everywhere less than 3 meters.

<h4>Room 2.0.3</h4>

This room has an area of 83.5 m2 and because of that, we’ll use 18 outlets. In this room we'll also have an Access Point (AP) and a consolidation point with 24 connectors.

<h4>Room 2.0.4 / 2.0.5 / 2.0.6</h4>

These rooms are the same size - 28.3m2 -, and have 6 outles in each room. The room 2.0.6 also have a consolidation point with 24 connectors.
