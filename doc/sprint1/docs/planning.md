RCOMP 2021-2022 Project - Sprint 1 planning
===========================================
### **Sprint master:** Rui Gon√ßalves - 1191831 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

T.1.1 Development of a structured cabling project for building 1, encompassing the campus backbone.<br>
T.1.2 Development of a structured cabling project for building 2.<br>
T.1.3 Development of a structured cabling project for building 3.<br>
*Once we are just 3 members, T.1.4 and T.1.5 were ignored.*

# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #
  * Fiber cable was used until the Horizontal cross-connect, after that we use Copper Cable.
  * Structured Cabling hierarchy:
    * Main cross-connect (one per network)
    * Intermediate cross-connect (one per building)
    * Horizontal cross-connect (one per floor)
    * Consolidation Points (none or more per floor)
  * Copper cable wiring standard adopted was the 568A. This standard will be used throughout the entire project to avoid conflict.
  
# 3. Subtasks assignment #
  * 1210813 - Structured cable for building 1
  * 1191831 - Structured cable for building 2
  * 1201694 - Structured cable for building 3
